# 3afiaPlus

### University Project — Digital Healthcare Mobile Application  
Developed with **Flutter** and **Dart**

---

## Project Overview

**3afiaPlus** is a mobile application designed to help **Algerian patients and doctors** plan and manage **medical consultations online**.  
It addresses the challenge of obtaining medical advice for **non-urgent or minor health issues** when it is difficult or inconvenient to visit a doctor in person.

The app provides a **safe, simple, and local digital healthcare platform**, enabling remote consultations, digital prescriptions, and appointment management — all tailored for Algeria’s growing e-health sector.

## Objectives

- Facilitate **remote medical consultations** between doctors and patients in Algeria.  
- Simplify **appointment scheduling and management** for both users.  
- Provide access to **digital prescriptions** and **follow-up consultations**.  
- Support **local doctors** in reaching more patients from different regions.  
- Demonstrate the use of **Flutter** for scalable, real-world health applications.

## Business Model

**3afiaPlus** will start with an advertising model, then transition to a **freemium model** once the user base grows.  
This hybrid approach supports scalability while keeping the app affordable for all users.

## Key Features

- **User Accounts:** Both **doctors** and **patients** can register and manage personal accounts.  
- **Doctor Availability:** Doctors from various specialties can set **available time slots** for consultations.
